## ReciPedia
Recipe search app



##Description
UI Project building a web application to search recipes. Users are able to quickly search for recipes by meal type, cuisine, ingredients, dish name
or popularity. There is a map feature as well, that will list nearby grocery stores. 

##Motivation
We created this application because we noticed a need for a recipe search that got straight to the point. Most websites for recipes will
include long back stories or wordy descriptions that make reading through the instructions quite tedious. We wanted to provide a service that 
answers all users' questions without straying too far away from the necessary information. ReciPedia is all about simplicity and useful 
information. 

##Features
-Home page with 3 featured recipes
-Category pages with lists of new, randomly generated upon each refresh, recipes pulled from our API
-A map detailing nearby grocery store


##Challenges and Solutions
-Understanding proper Git practices
-Getting and displaying information from our API. Solution: 
-Working through issues with our different machines

Solution: We asked a lot of questions, watched many tutorials, and learned through trial and error.
